I have attempted 3 out of the 5 given tasks. Please see the SAiDl Induction Assignment 2024.pdf first. It documents how I went about this assignment.

## Pruning and Sparcity

See `Pruning&Sparcity` directory:
- `VGGModel.ipynb` contains the code to build and train a simple VGG Model.
- `PruningAndSparcity.ipynb` contains the code to prune a dense VGG Model.

## Graph Neural Networks

See `GraphNeuralNetworks` directory:
- `GNN.ipynb` contains my code for the assignment.
- `Graph Attentional Networks.pdf` contains the literature review for the assignment.

## Natural Language Processing

See `NaturalLanguageProcessing` directory:
- `dataloading.ipynb` contains code to download dataset and then put it in text files for my use.
- `modelx.ipynb` contains various iterations of my model.
